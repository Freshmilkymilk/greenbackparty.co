                        <p>
                            “Every government degenerates when trusted to the rulers of the people alone. The people themselves are its only safe depositories.” This quote was told by a very influential founding father and president of our nation, Thomas Jefferson. Our nation was founded on principles of equality and individual freedom. Everything we take for granted today, including our economic prosperity, are based on these principles. But, these freedoms only exist because our government is there to provide us domestic tranquility, and security from losing our freedoms and rights. There would be no freedom if there was no law. Since the Great Depression however, our government has stepped past these boundaries to try and provide “welfare” for the people. Now, we as a nation owe trillions in national debt, face economic uncertainty, and allow for classified government actions, both domestic and international to take place. Our privacy is at stake, our livelihood is at stake, and our popular sovereignty is at stake.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We are the Greenback Party. An economic protest party focused on economic prosperity through no government intervention in our free market capitalist system. We also believe in a government that should step down its social spending and tax rates to allow for a 100% free market to run at peak efficiency. Healthcare and social security must gradually become privatized in order to acquire a fully free market. The government should not provide these expenditures but instead become a competitor of the market as well. Our military and national defense can benefit with private competition in order to protect life and property. Although we support a free market, we also will try to aim towards an environmentally “clean” market. This will be achieved through supporting private and public research towards environmental problems and advising businesses to opt for practical, environmental solutions. There will be no government regulations, as we believe the market will correct itself but if a practical “clean” solution is viable, we advise it. We are a party that is towards maintaining freedom but also actively socially responsible for the good of the nation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our focus towards social issues is very centrist and moderate, where we plan for our nation to remain secular with a strict adherence towards church and state. Campaign financial aid for our future elections should be heavily regulated in order with spending limits in order to lessen corruption between government official and those that finance their campaigns. Individual freedoms stated in the Bill of Rights and same-sex unions will always be protected by the government, but limited control will be placed on the 2nd amendment. Our view toward the controversial argument of abortion is pro-choice but with limits. There must also be a reform towards immigration laws, allowing for easier and fair legal passage into the country while trying to offset illegal immigration. Our country should always be open and socially progressive for both newcomers into our nation and our home-grown, red-blooded Americans.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The Greenback Party is here to provide a nation which can protect your natural rights as a human being in a progressive manner. The great United States of America was founded on these principles, with our founding fathers hoping to provide “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” Economic progress should not be held in chains to a massive bureaucracy that is our current U.S government. Our lives can only prosper if we maintain a life and market free of any government barriers. These barriers must be taken down in order for our nation to remain the best developed and affluent superpower. Only when this happens can our nation truly experience what the founding fathers had envisioned; a free and prosperous state.
